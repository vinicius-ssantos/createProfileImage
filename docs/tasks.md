# Improvement Tasks for Profile Image Generator

## Architecture and Design
[ ] 1. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanism for OpenAI API calls
[ ] 2. Add rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
[ ] 3. Create a more robust prompt generation strategy using profile attributes
[ ] 4. Implement caching mechanism to avoid regenerating existing images
[ ] 5. Add support for different image generation providers (not just OpenAI)
[ ] 6. Implement a proper domain model with separation from DTOs
[ ] 7. Create a configuration validator to ensure all required settings are present

## Code Quality
[ ] 8. Add comprehensive JavaDoc to all classes and methods
[ ] 9. Implement input validation for profile data
[ ] 10. Add more unit tests for edge cases and error scenarios
[ ] 11. Create integration tests for the OpenAI service
[ ] 12. Implement proper exception hierarchy for different error types
[ ] 13. Add logging throughout the application for better observability
[ ] 14. Refactor the ProfileService to follow Single Responsibility Principle

## Features
[ ] 15. Support for male profiles (currently only female profiles are included)
[ ] 16. Add ability to customize image generation parameters (size, style, etc.)
[ ] 17. Implement batch processing with progress tracking
[ ] 18. Add support for different output formats (PNG, WebP, etc.)
[ ] 19. Create a simple web UI for managing profiles and viewing generated images
[ ] 20. Add support for image metadata to store generation parameters

## Performance and Scalability
[ ] 21. Implement asynchronous processing for better throughput
[ ] 22. Add support for parallel image generation
[ ] 23. Implement a queue system for handling large batches of profiles
[ ] 24. Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
[ ] 25. Optimize image storage (compression, format selection)

## Security
[ ] 26. Implement secure storage of API keys (not just environment variables)
[ ] 27. Add content filtering to ensure generated images meet guidelines
[ ] 28. Implement access control for the API if exposed as a service
[ ] 29. Add audit logging for all image generation requests
[ ] 30. Implement proper HTTPS configuration if deployed as a web service

## Documentation
[ ] 31. Create comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions
[ ] 32. Add examples of different profile configurations
[ ] 33. Document the prompt generation strategy
[ ] 34. Create API documentation if exposed as a service
[ ] 35. Add a troubleshooting guide for common issues

## DevOps
[ ] 36. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
[ ] 37. Create Docker configuration for containerized deployment
[ ] 38. Implement environment-specific configuration
[ ] 39. Add health checks and monitoring
[ ] 40. Create backup and restore procedures for generated images
