# Improvement Tasks for Profile Image Generator

## Architecture and Design
[x] 1. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanism for OpenAI API calls
[x] 2. Add rate limiting to prevent API quota exhaustion
[x] 3. Create a more robust prompt generation strategy using profile attributes
[x] 4. Implement caching mechanism to avoid regenerating existing images
[x] 5. Add support for different image generation providers (not just OpenAI)
[x] 6. Implement a proper domain model with separation from DTOs
[x] 7. Create a configuration validator to ensure all required settings are present
[x] 8. Implement database persistence instead of in-memory storage
[x] 9. Add pagination support for listing profiles
[x] 10. Implement proper transaction management
[x] 11. Create environment-specific configuration profiles (dev, test, prod)

## Code Quality
[x] 12. Add comprehensive JavaDoc to all classes and methods
[x] 13. Implement input validation for profile data
[x] 14. Add more unit tests for edge cases and error scenarios
[x] 15. Create integration tests for the OpenAI service
[ ] 16. Implement proper exception hierarchy for different error types
[x] 17. Add logging throughout the application for better observability
[ ] 18. Refactor the ProfileService to follow Single Responsibility Principle
[ ] 19. Use consistent error handling across all services
[ ] 20. Replace RestTemplate with WebClient in all services
[x] 21. Add validation for Myers-Briggs personality types
[x] 22. Create enum for gender values instead of using strings
[ ] 23. Implement mapper classes for DTO-to-entity conversion

## Features
[ ] 24. Support for male profiles (currently only female profiles are included)
[ ] 25. Add ability to customize image generation parameters (size, style, etc.)
[ ] 26. Implement batch processing with progress tracking
[ ] 27. Add support for different output formats (PNG, WebP, etc.)
[ ] 28. Create a simple web UI for managing profiles and viewing generated images
[ ] 29. Add support for image metadata to store generation parameters
[ ] 30. Implement internationalization for prompts and responses
[ ] 31. Add support for profile search and filtering
[ ] 32. Implement profile import/export functionality
[ ] 33. Add support for profile templates

## Performance and Scalability
[ ] 34. Implement asynchronous processing for better throughput
[ ] 35. Add support for parallel image generation
[ ] 36. Implement a queue system for handling large batches of profiles
[ ] 37. Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
[ ] 38. Optimize image storage (compression, format selection)
[ ] 39. Implement connection pooling for external API calls
[ ] 40. Add request/response compression
[ ] 41. Implement circuit breaker pattern for external services
[ ] 42. Add load balancing for horizontal scaling

## Security
[ ] 43. Implement secure storage of API keys (not just environment variables)
[ ] 44. Add content filtering to ensure generated images meet guidelines
[ ] 45. Implement access control for the API if exposed as a service
[ ] 46. Add audit logging for all image generation requests
[ ] 47. Implement proper HTTPS configuration if deployed as a web service
[ ] 48. Add input sanitization for all user inputs
[ ] 49. Implement CORS configuration
[ ] 50. Add rate limiting for API endpoints
[ ] 51. Implement secure error handling (no sensitive information in error messages)
[ ] 52. Add security headers to API responses

## Documentation
[ ] 53. Create comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions
[ ] 54. Add examples of different profile configurations
[ ] 55. Document the prompt generation strategy
[ ] 56. Create API documentation if exposed as a service
[ ] 57. Add a troubleshooting guide for common issues
[ ] 58. Create architecture documentation with diagrams
[ ] 59. Document design decisions and trade-offs
[ ] 60. Add code style guidelines
[ ] 61. Create user manual for the application
[ ] 62. Document configuration options and environment variables

## DevOps
[x] 63. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
[x] 64. Create Docker configuration for containerized deployment
[x] 65. Implement environment-specific configuration
[x] 66. Add health checks and monitoring
[x] 67. Create backup and restore procedures for generated images
[ ] 68. Implement automated code quality checks
[x] 69. Add performance testing to CI/CD pipeline
[x] 70. Implement infrastructure as code
[ ] 71. Set up centralized logging
[x] 72. Create deployment documentation
