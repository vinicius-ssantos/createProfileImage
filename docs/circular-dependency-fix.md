# Circular Dependency Fix

## Issue Description

The application was failing to start due to a circular dependency in the metrics configuration. The error message was:

```
The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

   webMvcObservationFilter defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/actuate/autoconfigure/observation/web/servlet/WebMvcObservationAutoConfiguration.class]
      ↓
   observationRegistry defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/actuate/autoconfigure/observation/ObservationAutoConfiguration.class]
      ↓
   defaultMeterObservationHandler defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/actuate/autoconfigure/observation/ObservationAutoConfiguration$MeterObservationHandlerConfiguration$OnlyMetricsMeterObservationHandlerConfiguration.class]
┌─────┐
|  compositeMeterRegistry defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/actuate/autoconfigure/metrics/CompositeMeterRegistryConfiguration.class]
↑     ↓
|  configureMeterRegistry defined in class path resource [com/example/matchapp/config/MetricsConfig.class]
└─────┘
```

The circular dependency was between:
- `compositeMeterRegistry` (created by Spring Boot's auto-configuration)
- `configureMeterRegistry` (defined in our MetricsConfig class)

## Solution

### 1. Restructured MetricsConfig Class

We modified the MetricsConfig class to avoid the circular dependency by:

1. Replacing the single `configureMeterRegistry` method with individual bean methods for each metrics binder:
   - `classLoaderMetrics()`
   - `jvmMemoryMetrics()`
   - `jvmGcMetrics()`
   - `jvmThreadMetrics()`
   - `processorMetrics()`
   - `uptimeMetrics()`

2. Each of these methods returns a metrics binder bean without directly referencing the MeterRegistry.

3. Spring Boot's auto-configuration automatically binds these metrics binders to the available MeterRegistry beans.

### 2. Added Property for Test Environment

For the test environment, we added the following property to `application-test.properties`:

```properties
spring.main.allow-circular-references=true
```

This property allows Spring to resolve circular dependencies by breaking the cycle at runtime. While this is not ideal for production code, it provides a safety net for tests.

## Why This Works

The original issue was that `configureMeterRegistry` both:
1. Depended on a MeterRegistry (as a method parameter)
2. Was treated as a MeterRegistry bean provider (due to its return type)

This created a circular dependency when Spring tried to wire everything together.

Our solution breaks this cycle by:
1. Creating individual beans for each metrics binder
2. Letting Spring's auto-configuration handle binding these to the registry
3. Avoiding direct references to the MeterRegistry in bean definitions

For the test environment, we also allow circular references as a safety measure, but the primary fix is the restructuring of the MetricsConfig class.

## Best Practices

1. Avoid circular dependencies in your application design
2. Use individual, focused beans rather than complex configurations
3. Be cautious with bean methods that both consume and produce the same type
4. Consider using @PostConstruct for initialization logic that depends on other beans
5. Only use spring.main.allow-circular-references=true as a last resort, and preferably only in test environments
